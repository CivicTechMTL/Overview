# Volunteer-Onboarding

Welcome to the Civic Tech Organizing Team! We are happy to have you here. Below you will find information on how to contribute to Civic Tech Montreal. Please reach out to any members of the current management team if you have any further question. A list of members can be found on the (TODO: Link to team) page which is a directory of all current Civic Tech Co-organizers.

## Step 1: Discord

If you've made it to Notion, that means you've probably you've already been set up on Discord! Let's make sure you're all set. Take a minute to check if all the items in the following list have been completed:

- You have been added to the Civic Tech MTL discord channel and have introduced yourself in the Welcome channel ->  [https://discord.com/invite/5MwPPad](https://discord.com/invite/5MwPPad)
- You have been assign the co-organizer role in discord. Your name should be green.
- You have been added to the co-organizer channel and introduced yourself

Please contact the management team ASAP if you have not been assigned the appropriate role or if you have any other issues. 

## Step 2: Add yourself to the Directory

The directory of all Co-organizers can be found (TODO: Link to team) Add yourself, assign yourself the **unverified** tag and fill out any relevant information.

Co-organizers can be assigned 3 tags:

- **Unverified:** assigned to new co-organizers. This means every time you complete a task, it must be reviewed by a member of the organizing team before it can be marked as complete. Once you complete 10 tasks, you will become a **verified** member. There is no deadline to complete these 10 tasks. Once the 10 tasks are complete please contact a member of the management team to become verified.
- **Verified:** Co-organizers can now complete tasks without having the work be verified by a member of the management team. We still value collaboration and communication, but a formal review will no longer be necessary.
- **Manager:** Co-organizers who have been verified for some time can request to become a member of the management team. Managers review the tasks completed by **unverified** co-organizers and create the tasks. There are no restriction to who can become a manager and it is by request.

## Step 3: Start Completing some tasks!

Tasks are separated into 9 categories:

1. **Events:** tasks related to event planning. This could mean Zoom breakout room organization, accessibility, venues, food, Audio/Visual, etc.
2. **HackProj:** tasks related to Civic Tech Projects currently being worked on during our weekly hacknights. Perhaps a group needs extra support or we need to find out if they will be running next week.
3. **Socials:** tasks related to all social media campaigns and outreach on Instagram, twitter, facebook, etc.
4. **Finance:** tasks related to funding, grants, payments to subscriptions, etc.
5. **InternalProj:** tasks related to any improvements to out internal process'. This could mean revamping the Notion or any Civic Tech MTL led project.
6. **InternalComms:** tasks related to internal communication between participants and co-organizers. Any type of announcment.
7. **ExternalProj:** Projects in collaboration with other organizations or hosted by other organiztions that we are related to.
8. **ExternalComms:** Any type of external communication to other orgs, speakers, future collaborators, external support, etc.
9. **Misc:** Tasks that do not meet the specifications of any other category.

These are the following steps to take to complete tasks:

1. Consult the **Master Roadmap** (TODO: Link to Roadmap) Consult the list of current project in the works. The projects are labelled with **High, Medium**, and **Low**. Co-organizers will usually be assigned a project to work on during our monthly meeting, but if not select a project you like based on priority level and interest. 
2. Each project listed in the **Master Roadmap** has its own page on Notion. Each one of these pages has a detailed description and a **board** with all tasks associated to this project. Here is an example board below. Follow the following steps:

TODO: Link to example board

2.a. Select task you want to complete. Simply scroll through the **Not Started** column until you find something you like or you can filter tasks based on the following properties:2.

- **Label:** Select what type of task you want to compete (outlined above).
- **Priority:** Urgent, Normal, Later. Try to select **Urgent** ones first.
- **Time:** The approximate amount of time the task will take.

TODO: create example board and link to it

2.b. Select the task you wish to complete. For this example we will select **Message Company X.** Assign yourself to the task and move it to the in progress column. Only assign yourself to tasks located in the **Not Started** column. If you wish to contribute to a task in the **In Progress** column, reach out to that person on Discord. If you do not think you will be able to complete a task, that's ok, things happen! Just try to find a replacement on discord asap, especially if its a high priority task.

TODO: example board

2.c. Once completed, add any relevant comments. Make sure to comment how long the task actually took to complete. This is not to track anyone we just want to make sure our estimates are correct and we'll adjust accordingly. Then move it to the **To Review** column and reach out to someone on the Management team to review it. Once you have completed 10 tasks, you can move your completed tasks directly to the **Completed** column

## Conclusions

That's the basics! Any question can be asked in the organizers chat and suggestions and feedback are encouraged and welcome. Welcome to the team and looking forward to looking for you in the long term!
