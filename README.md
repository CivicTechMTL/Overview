# Overview

# Mission

The Civic Tech Community aims to solve civic issues with a human centered approach, bringing together technologists, designers, policy nerds, artists, and general members of the community to collaborate and come up with solutions to issues that matter most to them.

This is done by attending organized "hacknights", where participants can pitch their own projects, or collaborate with other Community led organizations to help them reach their goals with technology. It’s a great way to contribute to open source projects and to have an impact on your community! Everyone is welcome and tech knowledge is definitely not a requirement.

# Values

ctMTL would like to acknowledge that Montreal is located on Tiohtià:ke, the unceded traditional territory of the Kanien’kehá:ka nation, recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. 

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from events and online forums.
